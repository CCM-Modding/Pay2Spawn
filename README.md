Pay2Spawn for 1.7.2
===================
**Please note: Sound rewards have been removed in the 1.7.2 version, until I can figure out how the new sound engine works.**<br>
*This project is in limbo, aka no new features mode. I will make effort to fix bugs and keep up with MC version changes, until I get more free time.*<br>

Screw or help your favourite streamer!

Featuring customisable item, entity, potion effects and much more spawning if a viewers donates.<br>
The reward is based on the donation amount.<br>

Forge required, mod needed server side.<br>
**If you encounter issues with other mods, please make a bugreport!**

I can't demand this, but I ask for respect and gratitude for the time and effort put into the project by all developers, testers, designers and documenters. ~~Dries007

The idea & proper credit
------------------------
MazeXD and DSlacky made a similar mod first, they should receive all credit for the idea.
It seems like production on there mod has halted, if someone finds an up to date link, let us know.
